# simple_spaceships
A web-based space game.

## Notes:
* Use BufferGeometry and BufferAttribute for all objects since their geometry will not be manipulated after creation.

## Brainstorming:
* Can justify limiting the distance from stations and POI by having ships be induction powered.
	* This will make the universe feel small.  Doesn't account for bookmarks.
